# Sample article

06/06/2022

This is the description of the article. It is the first paragraph of the article, just after the top-level heading and the date.

## First section

The compiler will automatically generate sections in the article. It can also generate a table of content. For now, every markdown element is not supported, but the goal is to have it working eventually.
Here is a second line of text. It should be in the same paragraph.

This line is separated by an empty line. This should be a separate paragraph.
