    <h1>Designing a portfolio to load and display markdown files as HTML</h1>
    <h4>Mon 6 Jun 2022</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        I've recently been working on so many different projects at once that I've never found the time to update my portfolio, which has been unchanged since the beginning of the year.
        Since then, a lot of things have changed : I no longer use the same technologies, have the same interests, and I started to dislike the graphic style of the website. Even some of my contact information
        Was completely outdated : something had to be done.

    <h2>Maybe a blog is not as lame as it sounds</h2>

    <p>
        While talking about web technologies with a friend on Discord, he told me about <a href="https://showdownjs.com">Showdown.js</a>, a package that allows you to convert markdown files into HTML.
        This was a great idea, and reminded me about another direction I wanted to give to my website for a while : a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be clear, I've always found having a blog was a bit "cringy". I've only seen a few good blogs that weren't managed by big compagnies, and they almost always are managed with a CMS such as wordpress, Hugo, or Jekyll.
        Those tools are great, but I've always been a big fan of building everything myself, and having the least amount of tools between the language I'm using (here : web technologies) and the final product.
        Seeing the mess of a file structure that generates frameworks such as React for example, I prefer to build everything myself so I'm sure I can keep everything clean and tidy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having a blog was of little to no interest for me at the time, because I was sure that I would never be able to manage it and write enough for it to be interesting.
        Moreover, I'm young and my life was not that interesting.
        I did not live in an exciting environment, and I did not code anything original, but rather completing tutorials and meaningless little projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year, things has changed a bit. I've moved to a new, bigger, more interesting city, made new friends, and more importantly changed my mindset.
        My major concern now is to keep traces. Traces of the incredible moments I live with my friends, but also traces of what I do, code, experiment with, and learn.
        I'm sure this will be useful to at least one person, which is me, and that's already a good thing.
